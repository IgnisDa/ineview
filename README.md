# Ineview

Inéview is a next generation AI powered interview expert that can be used to perform real time interviews as well as train potential candidates for interviews.

Using a plethora of leading technologies like natural language processing and facial expression recognition using convolutional neural networks,  Inéview will show you all the places you can improve while interviewing, from the words you speak, the number of times you faltered or hesitated to the body language you showed. It aggregates all of this data and presents it with an easy to understand interface which can be used to drive decisions like whether to hire someone or simply be used by job seekers to improve their interview skills. Inéview’s emotions detector will be built using Tensorflow CNN on visual studio code. Meanwhile, the answers that users give during interviews will be analyzed and rated using techniques like noun phrase extraction, Tokenization, ngrams, word inflection, lemmatization, and decision trees. Our AI will be trained on the google cloud platform. Our aim is to build a website which will host our algorithm and will be capable of video and audio capture and further analysis.
